                    While this genre doesn't need an explanation or pointer,
                    let's just say this is what you get when sublime Afrobeat - the authentic African sound - <br>
                    and Gospel have a baby that feels like church and continental culture. <br>
                    In simpler terms, itâ€™s music that speaks of Jesus in the African way.

                    We all know those songs that get us dancing and vibing while we nod to the deeper meanings of the lyrics. <br>
                    So whether it's a fast beat, quicker delivery of the words or the uptown atmosphere of the song, <br>
                    HipHop and Rap play a great role in reaching out to quarters of our society that seem cut off. <br>
                    Our young ears love the vibe and it pays that we get the message of Christ in our bracket and context. <br>

                    This is a mothership of Gospel Music. <br>
                    This is a great mix of Urban contemporary Music with potent features of praise and worship. <br>
                    These are the songs we call G.O.S.P.E.L and we don't have to mince words around why we call them Gospel. <br> 
                    If you wish to sample this genre, listen to Dante Bowe, Mercy Chinwo, Tasha Cobbs Leonard, Mercy Me, Israel Houghton, Jonathan Reynolds, and William McDowell to name but a few.

                <p>
                    The Reggae beat is both simple to recognize, easy to flow with, and often filled with conscious lyrics and an entire vibe in our minds. <br> 
                    We've even seen artistes and music ministers who aren't primarily Reggae-prune take up this movement-inspired genre and we honestly love them. <br> 
                    Still unsure of how that could be, check out Lauren Daigle's "Your Wings'' and "You Got Up" by Travis Greene.
